# Chicago_Crime_Analysis_AR
Analyzed the marginal effects of variables on Crime in Chicago from 2010 to 2020 and built recommendations for crime reduction.
In the United States, more than 7 people per hour die a violent death. In 2020 alone, there were 538,203 violent crime reported incidents in the US.Coming to the areas in the U.S which are affected due to Violent Crime, it was observed that the average annual overall violent crime rate in urban areas was about 74% higher than the average rural rate and 37% higher than the average suburban rate.  

When it comes to Urban Crime, we performed analysis of the cities in the U.S which have the highest violent crimes and decided on City of Chicago for this project. The rate of violent crime in the Chicago metro area is 4.19 per 1,000 residents during a standard year. The Chicago total amount of daily crime is 1.98 times more than the Illinois average and 1.67 times more than that of the nation. As for violent crimes, the daily average in Chicago is 2.21 times more than the Illinois average, and it is 2.43 times more than the national average. The odds of being the victim of a violent crime in Chicago are 1 in 103. Thatâ€™s double the average chances for the state of Illinois. Crimes disrupt the development and the safety of the citizens. Murder, rape, and robbery are most common violent crimes in Chicago which have been reported by Chicago Police department. Chicago was responsible for nearly half of 2016's increase in homicides in the US, which shows the high levels of violent crimes in the city compared to other cities in the country.

Police databases accumulate a large amount of data that could be analyzed to reduce crime rates. The analysis of criminal activity and the prediction of number of crimes remains one of the most interesting problems for the researchers. Police Departments & Governments across the world have been collecting data to analyze and understand how this massive problem could be cut down and how these violent crimes can be reduced to protect the lives of civilians, citizens and prevent loss to livelihood and the economy.


For this analysis, we chose data on community area level of Chicago city (which is divided into 77 community areas) from 2010 to 2020. The data has been sourced from Chicago government websites and used for GLMER modelling. Our key findings are that, increasing the number of public schools, health support agencies and encouraging high school education will help reduce crime in community areas by 2%, 8.3% and 153% respectively.
